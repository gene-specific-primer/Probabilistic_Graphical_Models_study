This module describes algorithms for finding the most likely assignment for a distribution encoded as a 
PGM (a task known as MAP inference). We describe message passing algorithms, which are very similar to the 
algorithms for computing conditional probabilities, except that we need to also consider how to decode 
the results to construct a single assignment. In an optional module, we describe a few other algorithms 
that are able to use very different techniques by exploiting the combinatorial optimization nature of the MAP task.
